## Key Contributions:

- TCP/IP and UDP Implementation: Engineered a network simulation that accurately models TCP/IP and UDP protocols, demonstrating proficiency in fundamental networking concepts.

- Client-Server Architecture: Developed a robust client-server communication system, managing socket connections for reliable data transmission. This required in-depth knowledge of networking principles and socket programming in C++.

- HTTP Request Handling: Integrated HTTP request handling into the simulation, allowing for realistic data exchanges that mimic real-world web communication.

## Technical Challenges Overcome:

- Low-Level Networking: Navigated the complexities of low-level networking, including packet construction and error handling, to ensure accurate protocol simulation.

- Performance Optimization: Implemented various performance optimizations to handle concurrent client connections efficiently, minimizing latency and resource usage.

## Project Impact:

- Enhanced Networking Skills: This project significantly enhanced my understanding of networking, from the theoretical concepts to practical implementation. It allowed me to gain hands-on experience with protocol design and real-world network communication.

- Technical Expertise:
  Through this project, I demonstrated my technical expertise in C++, networking, and systems programming, making me well-prepared for roles that require strong problem-solving skills and in-depth knowledge of networking protocols.
