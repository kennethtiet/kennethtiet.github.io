Fixed up this 1940's Esterbrook for a client. This is a Red Esterbrook with a 9550(Firm Extra Fine) nib. 

Repair was a simple job. Pictures and descriptions below. Thanks to Kim for letting me work on her pen!

## Sac Replacement
Old original sac was twisted and hardened. I simply removed the old sac, shellac'd a new sac, and covered the new sac in talc powder.

## Nib Polishing
I used a little bit of simichrome to clean the nib up. Love how satisfying it looks when nibs clean up well.

## Nib Tuning
This pen required some alignment and some light grinding to smooth out all of the rough edges.

## Body Polishing
Used a little bit of simichrome and applied wax for decent clean up and a nice shine. The pen came out well!
