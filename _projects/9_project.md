Created a food menu for home use. My family struggles sometimes on deciding what to cook so my sister and I created a food menu complete with categories, pictures, and huge text to speed up our decision making process.

Its not the best visually unlike some great templates we found on canva, but it does the job pretty well!

This menu sits on our kitchen counter and is frequently used for food inspiration.

We focused on adding foods that were:

- easy to make
- interchangeable ingredients
- different enough so that we didn't add redundant items and made the menu super big

Here are some of the pages we have on our menu:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/menu/food.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/menu/food2.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/menu/food3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
