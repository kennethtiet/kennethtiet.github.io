## Introduction

If you're anything like our family, sometimes we can't decide what to cook for dinner. We would think and present all of the ideas in our head on what to cook. We would look in our fridge, dispute what we wanted to make, and end up taking way too long figuring out what to make all while also being hungry. And so a solution was needed to reduce our time to make a decision, reduce decision fatigue, and get food on the dinner table.

So what was the solution? A menu of course.

My sister and I got to work immediately to build out our menu. The rest of this page details how we did it:

## Planning

We focused on adding foods that we:

- wanted to eat
- and were easy to make

We started by brainstorming a list of all the foods and pruned them until we got our final set of foods.

## Implementation

From then on we gathered pictures of the food as well as the name and organized them and built the pages of the menu on canva. We then printed the pages in color at our local library, placed them in sheet protectors, and collected them in a binder that rests on our kitchen counter. This menu has helped reduced the time it takes to choose what to make for dinner!

Here are some of the pages we have on our menu:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/menu/food.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/menu/food2.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/menu/food3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

## Closing Thoughts

All in all, this has been a fun project. It has helped us reduce our decision fatigue and decide on meals faster. Some improvments I would make would be to standardize the size of the images so they are more consistent in the menu, as well as standardizing the text.
