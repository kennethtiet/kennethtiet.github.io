Hey there! Welcome to the 'site. My name's Kenneth. I recently graduated from USC with a B.S. in Computer Science.

Currently, I conduct [research](https://bpb-us-e2.wpmucdn.com/sites.uci.edu/dist/2/5230/files/2023/09/64_SCR_23_Kenneth_Tiet.pdf) at the [USC Haptics Robotics and Virtual Interaction Lab](https://sites.usc.edu/culbertson/) and teach robotics at the [Institute of Arts, Music, & Science](http://www.iams-usa.org/).

Previously, I was a software intern building industry software tools at [RoviSys](https://www.rovisys.com).
