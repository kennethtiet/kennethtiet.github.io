## What do I do for fun?

I like writing, reflecting, and breathing.

I like journaling and meditating.

I also like sorting my thoughts.

Good company, good food, and silence is pretty good too.

This was in-part generated using ChatGPT.

In my past, I rode bikes and swam a lot. I like and still like restoring [fountain pens](https://kennethtiet.github.io/pencollection/) but I haven't fixed anything in a while.

Thanks for coming by my page.
